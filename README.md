Title: Alzheimer Prediction by Handwriting Recognition

Problem Statement: The objective of this project is to explore whether Alzheimer disease can be predicted through handwriting recognition. The DARWIN dataset includes handwriting data from 174 participants. 

Data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nfAsVJVhgAfbQqvX4SbNl_w0Lj786DBA?usp=drive_link 

Tasks: Identify significant handwriting features in order to identify the person is suffering from Alzheimer. The class labels in the data set are P (patient) or H (health people). Design novel feature selection framework or use the existing techniques with proper justifications to identify salient features of the given handwriting recognition data set. Report the performance of different classification techniques on the training data to demonstrate that the proposed feature selection scheme is working well. Subsequently, execute the best framework on the test data and submit the class labels in a text file. Each row of the text file will contain the class label of an instance of the test data e.g., H following the order of the given test data.
